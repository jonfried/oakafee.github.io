As far as I understand it, Latin American immigration to NJ is a relatively recent phenomenon, not going back much earlier than the 1960s, and reaching a peak more recently. Now, the demographic category "Hispanic or Latino (any race)" accounts for 13% of NJ's population, reflecting a massive migration. Despite the limitations of this somewhat strange demographic designation, the indication of a globally significant population shift is clear.

Many of the same neighborhoods of NJ's cities that played host to European immigrants in the early 20th century have gone on to be of service to Dominican, Colombian, Salvadoran, Peruvian, Mexican and other immigrants in more recent decades. However, the economic landscape surrounding these neighborhoods has changed dramatically in the past century, even if the city blocks themselves look similar. Extensive suburban development has rendered the cities more marginal, and today urban immigration happens alongside more suburban immigration trends, which tend to only be open to wealthier immigrants.

Charting the location of every enclave of every Latin American nationality in NJ would be an overwhelming but fascinating project. All of NJ's major cities, and many towns, have sizeable Latin neighborhoods. Paterson, Elizabeth, Union City, and some smaller cities are overwhelmingly Latin American in character. 

Drive down Bergenline Ave in Hudson County and you'll get a sense of the massive scale and diversity of NJ's Latin Americans.
