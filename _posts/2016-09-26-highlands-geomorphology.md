The NJ Highlands are the real bowels of the earth, brought from the firey depth to the surface. The formation of its resilient bedrock is a long story, dating back in some cases over a billion years (that's 1/4 of the planet's estimated lifespan), featuring so many earth processes and such differnt points in the planet’s development that geologists admit to being overwhelmed. A USGS authority concludes that “faults and bedrock structures in the Highlands region have exceedingly complex histories that are challenging to discern” [1]. When the Highlands bedrock was first dredged back up to the surface, it probably was a big mountain rainge, but hundreds of millions of years of erosion have since worn it down. 

To shorten this lengthy story, the Highlands are a swath of very old, very hard rock that now shares the daylight of contemprary NJ with younger, comparatively simpler rocks on either side. The region is no longer especially mountainous, but its elevation and ruggedness today are due its resistance to erosion compared with its softer neighbors. Its average elevation increases gradually as you go north.

Glaciers! Once upon a time, it was cold out, and glaciers like those you might find today in the Arctic stretched across the northern half or North America, as far south as NJ. Actually, this tends to happen whenever it's cold out for a period of thousands of years. The most recent glaciers to cover the continent, which geologists named after Wisconsin, picked somewhere right near I-80's route across the Highlands as the place to stop their advance. Glaciers are moving sheets of ice thousands of feet thick that have huge effects on the landscapes they cross: sculpting hills and mountains, filling in valleys with debris, and scraping away the soil from pretty much everywhere.  As a result, the southern and northern halves of the Highlands look very different, and have had very different human histories. See the page on <a href="/land/highlands/outlying areas/highlands-land-use-history.html">the land use history of the Highlands</a> for details. 

The northern Highlands are now classic NJ hiking country, with exposed bedrock ledges on glacially scoured hilltops providing nice views. Soils tend to be thin and rocky.

The southern Highlands contain some fertile valleys with limestone and dolomite interspersed with wide ridges of classic Highlands bedrock.
