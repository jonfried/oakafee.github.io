<i>From contributor Jon Fried:</i>My main association with Bergen County is the blue laws that keep the malls closed on Sundays, which seems to fly in the face of some sacred laws of New Jersey.

## Fort Lee

Fort Lee is a city perched high above the Hudson River on the top of the Palisades, where the Palisades really start getting large and dramatic as they run north. The western end of the George Washington Bridge (GWB) is anchored into the top of the diabase cliff, hundreds of feet over the river. The sight of this noble and esteemed structure jutting out over the water, serenely proclaiming Depression-era America's mastery over the continent's rugged terrain, is powerful.

Despite its density, intense real estate development and close proximity to a major metropolis, Fort Lee maintains a small-town feel. It has main street-like commercial districts and strip malls which are clean, safe, relatively calm and pleasant to walk around. Fort Lee's population, while diverse, has large Japanese-American and Korean-American elements. Visitors can enjoy great Korean restaurants, ramen noodles, karaoke, and probably all sorts of other stuff I haven't had the chance to try yet, all in a relaxed setting. The massive transportation infrastructure surrounding the GWB is unfortunately very prominent in the town. It must be noted that this maze of roads and traffic, combined with some ugly new large commercial and residential buildings, detracts from the city's charm a bit, although it could also be said to add a certain a Jerseyesque anti-charm. Altogether, Fort Lee feels very prosperous and suburban, which is remarkable considering its proximity to some extremely urban, working-class areas across the river. It is almost impossible to speak of it in the same breath as <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/land-use/cities-and-towns/urban-core/hudson-county/jersey-city.html">Jersey City</a> and <a href="http://interpretation-of-nj.com/land-use/cities-and-towns/hudson-county/hoboken.html">Hoboken</a>.

Housing-wise, it's a mix of nice detatched suburban homes, co-op apartments of various sizes, condos, and rentals. The mix is a bit odd. There are a lot of people and a lot of big buildings all in an area that nevertheless doesn't feel like a city. It is all about commuting, which is unfortunate because the public transit options aren't so good. The jitney bus system that starts in Jersey City and goes up the Palisades does cross the GWB, but traffic can be nightmarish. The bridge is just wide enough to make walking across impractical, except recreationally. There is New York access on a NJ Transit bus through the Lincoln Tunnel, but that can't be fun, considering how many towns you have to pass through between Fort Lee and Weehawken. I feel bad for the people I know who have lived in Fort Lee and tried to live urban lifestyles, because it always seemed like a major hastle. Though your rent money goes almost absurdly far in Fort Lee, at least compared to the neighboring city.

## Edgewater

A narrow strip along the Hudson, below the Palisades. There was a Ford plant there, taking advantage of the deep water of the Hudson for ships to dock. It used to be an industrial wasteland, but in my lifetime an enormous amount of residential and commercial development has transformed it. Everything is new but seems to be a bit cheap — an entire housing development went up in flame like matchsticks recently. There are  old buildings between ballooning box stores. There is an incredible Japanese mall there, which seems to attract people from great distances.

## Teaneck

Not a typical suburban town. A lot of 1920's era housing gives it a classy feel. It's diverse — there is a long-standing black community, a Latino population and a lot of Orthodox Jews, some of whom I'm related to. My cousin, who used to live there, said that the Jews and blacks mainly live in separate neighborhoods. It has a large rock venue in a downtown-ish area which also serves emphatically mediocre Mexican food.

## Hackensack

A small city with a mix of land uses, from tall apartment buildings to spread-out suburban streets, Hackensack seems to be home to a variety of economic classes of people while remaining distinctly non-shitty throughout, to my knowledge. It has a highly regarded hospital, the Hackensack Regional Medical Center.

A Thelonious Monk composition is named after Hackensack, presumably named after a famous jazz recording studio that was located here. There is also a Fountains of Wayne song wth the same name, using the city to represent a boring and depressing life, which I think is unfair.

## Alpine

L'il Kim lives in this very wealthy town bordering New York on the west slope of the Palisades, along with some other celebrities. Mansions and lots of trees. It's interesting that despite the area's close proximity to the metropolis, it's kind of marginal, because of the natural barrier of the Palisades, I believe.

## Ridgewood

A nice downtown and an express train stop.

## Ho-ho-kus

A cool name, reminiscent of "Hoboken," and an interesting train station underneath a cliff in a gorge.

## Hillsdale

Has an annual wine festival, where all the suburban parents get drunk.

## Mahwah

Headquarters of the New York/New Jersey Trail Conference. A Ford plant was located here for a long time. Sort of exurban without much of a downtown, apparently. Located on the edge of the Highlands physiographic province, right next to the Ramapo Mountains, so decent hiking is not far off.

## Paramus

Dominated by one of NJ's best known malls, as well as an Ikea. I'm sure people live there. 

## Other suburbs

There are a lot of other suburbs in Bergen County, which are served by NJ Transit's reliable Main Line/Bergen County Line and spottier Pascack Valley Line. I don't have much firsthand experience with these towns, but I know some people from them. I hope will contribute their perspectives to this website.
