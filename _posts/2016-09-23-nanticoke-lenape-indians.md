The Nanticoke Lenni-Lenape Tribal Nation is based around the town of Bridgeton in Cumberland County, a rural, agriculture-oriented area in far South Jersey. They trace their history back to a 19th century joining of forces between Lenape who remained in their ancestral homeland and Nanticoke who migrated from the Delmarva Peninsula. 

Today the nation has a constitutionally organized government, tribal grounds, a non-profit "social services/community development association," a museum, a store and other infrastructure, all deep in South Jersey.
