 Northern NJ has a lot of pretty spots but most of them are on a fairly small scale. The Delaware Water Gap is large and imposing on a level beyond any other mountain or mountain-like feature in the state. Located on our western border and, geologically speaking, at the eastern boundary of the sedimentary Appalachian Mountains, it always seems to me like the gateway to the interior US, a hint of the wide rivers, long ridges, broad forested plateaus and endless fertile lowlands one encounters travelling west from our small, densely packed state.
